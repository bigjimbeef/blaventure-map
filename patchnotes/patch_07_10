*General*

*NEW*
- Added Bonus Streaks!
	- The more enemies you can kill in a row, the better rewards you will get
		- GP rewards for defeating enemies will scale, non-linearly, with Bonus Streak
	- When you defeat enemies, your streak will accumulate
	- When you rest, your streak is reset
	- Running away from enemies will decrease your streak slightly
	- Your streak will increase more against harder enemies
