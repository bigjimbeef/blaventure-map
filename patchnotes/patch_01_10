*General*

*NEW*
- Monster scaling has changed!
	- Monsters higher level than you are now /significantly/ more able to kill you
	- Both your character and monsters are now able to miss
	- Miss chance is governed by the level gap between you

*NEW*
- Added coloured indication of the monster's level relative to yours
	- Green (Easy):          Will die with no effort
	- White (Normal):        A regular challenge
	- Yellow (Hard):         Puts up a fight, could kill you
	- Red (Very Hard):       Dangerous to fight, but doable
	- Magenta (Impossible):  Suicide. Run away.

Ignore these indicators at your own peril!
