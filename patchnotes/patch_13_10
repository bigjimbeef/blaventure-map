	- P (precision):  Chance to hit monsters (higher Precision stops misses against high-level targets)
	- E (endurance):  Controls the amount of HP the character has
	- R (reflexes):   Governs the dodge chance of a character
	- S (strength):   Increases attack damage, both with weapons and spells.
	- O (oddness):    Controls the MP of the character.
	- N (nerve):      Corresponds to the defense of the character
	- A (acuity):     Critical hit chance is controlled by Acuity

*NEW*
Dynasties

- Upon first play this patch, you will be prompted to create a Dynasty
- Dynasty name is your character's surname, and is chosen only once

- It is a cross-character persistent layer, which carries a PERSONA of its own
	- Upgrading the stats for your Dynasty will apply those stats to every character in that Dynasty from then on
	- Gold gained by characters is added to the Dynasty coffers
	- Cost of upgrading the stats increases with Dynasty level, and stat rank

- See "blaventure.bgk.io" for a basic build calculator


*Balance*

- Introduction of Dynasties has lead to necessity for balance tweaks.

- Monster scaling has been changed to be much more difficult at higher levels
	- High-level monsters now have greater health
	- High-level monsters now hit much harder


*Bug Fixes*

- Streak will now reset properly on resting
